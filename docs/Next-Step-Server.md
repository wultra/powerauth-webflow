# NextStep Server

Next Step Server resolves the Next Step of the authentication process, handled authentication using credentials and OTP authorization codes, and manages user identities.

You can obtain the war file which can be deployed to a Java EE container in [releases](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-webflow/releases).

The configuration of Next Step Server is described in [Next Step Configuration](./Web-Flow-Configuration.md#next-step-server).

Next step definitions need to be configured before deploying Next Step Server, see chapter [Configuring Next Step](Configuring-Next-Step.md).
