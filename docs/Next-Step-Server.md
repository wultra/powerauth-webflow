# NextStep Server

Next Step Server resolves the Next Step of the authentication process, handled authentication using credentials and OTP authorization codes, and manages user identities.

You can obtain the war file which can be deployed to a Java EE container in [releases](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-webflow/releases).

The configuration of Next Step Server is described in [Next Step Configuration](./Web-Flow-Configuration.md#next-step-server).

Next step definitions need to be configured before deploying Next Step Server, see chapter [Configuring Next Step](Configuring-Next-Step.md).

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

You may configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.

| Property                                                | Default value | Description                                                                           |

| `powerauth.nextstep.security.auth.type`                 |               | `OIDC` for OpenID Connect. If OIDC enabled, the properties bellow must be configured. |
| `spring.security.oauth2.resource-server.jwt.issuer-uri` |               | URL of the provider, e.g. `https://sts.windows.net/example/`                          |
